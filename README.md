# Is your birthday lucky
  
Imp: For every app you make do CSS at the end. first have a working app by doing HTML and building logic in js.

There is no closing tag in the input element and 
difference between input and textarea:
input is generally used for small inputs and we can also specify type such as date, name, number etc. on the other hand, textarea is used for longer text. However since textarea has a closing tag we can put inside what we want to be displayed until user types in the textarea.

give the class or id name of the very first div as container.

label (for property )is a good practice to use so that the browser knows that this particular text is related to which input tag.

example:
<label for="date-of-birth">Date Of Birth</label>
<input type = "date" class = ".date-of-birth">

There are various types in the input taf such as date, number and radio etc.


dob.charAt(i): This is giving us character at the position i in the string.
Number(dob.charAt(i)): we are typecasting and converting a character into a number.
dob.replaceAll("-", ""): we used replaceAll to replace all the - from the string dob.

To change name in the tab:
<title>Is Your Birthday Lucky</title>
